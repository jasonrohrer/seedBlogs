This README file will tell you everything you need to know about using 
seedBlogs to build your website.  This document assumes that you have already
read the INSTALL document.




-- What to expect --

seedBlogs is a PHP/MySQL framework that allows you to seamlessly plug dynamic
blocks of content (for example, mini-blogs, user-editable blocks, and link 
lists) into your website wherever you need them.  seedBlogs is a *tool*, not
a just-add-water-website.

Thus, you should not expect seedBlogs to do much of anything right out of the
box.  This is *not* a monolithic, quick-install content management system 
(CMS).  seedBlogs will not hand you a working, snazzy website immediately after
installation.  However, it will give you a simple and powerful tool that you 
can use to craft a dynamic website that suits your needs.  

Instead of wrestling with a CMS and trying to figure out how "they" are doing
things, instead of sifting through complicated CSS files while trying to make 
a "skin" that suits your needs, instead of trying to learn their plug-in 
architecture just so you can get the basic functionality that you want, you 
can build your website your way, using whatever techniques you want.  If you 
want to use CSS, that is fine.  If you want to use plain HTML, that is fine 
also.  You design the website---seedBlogs simply handles the dynamic part.

Furthermore, adding seedBlogs-powered dynamic content to an existing website is
a very simple task.  If you already have a static website designed and 
deployed, you are much more than halfway there.  In fact, the hard part is 
really *designing* the website, not using seedBlogs as part of that website.

The only constraint on your website design is that you must use .php files 
wherever you plan to have seedBlogs-generate content appear.  For example, if 
your existing website is based on an index.html or index.shtml file, you will 
need to convert that file into an index.php file.  This conversion process 
should be relatively painless, since any HTML file contents are already valid 
PHP contents.  PHP files are simply HTML files that support an extra pair of 
tags, <?php  and  ?> , which allow you to write PHP code right in the middle 
of your HTML.  Before serving the page, a PHP-enabled web server will process 
all of the PHP code and insert whatever HTML is generated by the code inline 
with the rest of your HTML.



-- seedBlogs features --

  -- Database of posts is fully-searchable using keywords

  -- RSS 2.0 feeds for each seedBlog
  
  -- BBCode supported for formatting posts
     (see  http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/faq.php?mode=bbcode  for more info)
  
  -- Post lists displayed with blocks of intro text or with headlines only

  -- Optional expiration date for each post (useful for upcoming events)

  -- Posts can be sorted in newest-first or expires-soonest order
  
  -- Post order can be set into "custom" mode and tweaked manually by admins




-- What you need to know about PHP --

How much do you need to understand about PHP to use seedBlogs?  First, you 
need to understand the basics about what PHP does, which is described in this 
section.  Then, you need to know how to call the seedBlogs PHP functions.  You
can essentially copy-and-paste the example PHP calls, fill in your own 
parameter values, and get full use out of seedBlogs.

A quick example of basic PHP functionality is:

    <HTML>
    <HEAD><TITLE>Test PHP</TITLE></HEAD>
   
    <BODY>
    Hello, your web browser is <?php echo( $_SERVER[ 'HTTP_USER_AGENT' ] ); ?> 
    </BODY>
   
    </HTML>

A PHP-enabled server would process the bit of code between the <?php  ?> tags.
The "echo" function is used to print out a given piece of data.
$_SERVER is an array of variables describing the state of the web server.
HTTP_USER_AGENT selects the user agent variable out of the array.

Before sending the HTML to your browser, the server might process it to 
produce:

    <HTML>
    <HEAD><TITLE>Test PHP</TITLE></HEAD>
   
    <BODY>
    Hello, your web browser is Mozilla/4.0
    </BODY>
   
    </HTML>

Thus, your browser receives pure HTML.



-- How seedBlogs works --

To insert a seedBlog-controlled content block at a particular place in your
website, you simply call a PHP function.  For example, you might call:

    <?php
        include_once( "seedBlogs.php" );
        seedBlog( "news", 1 );
    ?> 
  
The  <?php  and  ?>  tags tell your web server where the PHP code starts and
stops.  The  include_once  call tells PHP to include the seedBlogs.php file
so that the seedBlogs function calls are available.  Finally, the heart of
this code block is the seedBlog function call.  We are creating a blog that
will be called "news" in the database.  The  1  parameter tells seedBlogs
to include a block of intro text in the list for each post displayed.  Calling
this function with  0  instead would show only a list of headlines and hide the
intro text blocks.

So what does this function call do?  It generates and inserts an HTML display 
for the "news" seedBlog using the default display settings.  If there are
any posts in the database for the "news" seedBlog, they will be included
in the display.   

This is the general mechanism by which seedBlogs operates:  you call various
functions, and it generates HTML and displays it wherever you call those 
functions.  Thus, seedBlogs does not care about the overall structure of your
website.

But the functionality does not stop at just displaying a simple "news" seedBlog
with default settings.  Other, more advanced function calls offer you a more
detailed level of control.  Those function calls are each described in detail
below.

Note that the  include_once( "seedBlogs.php" );  call only needs to appear one
time in each of your website's PHP files.  It is best to put this call at the
very top of each file to ensure that the seedBlogs functions are "loaded" 
before you try call any of them.  In addition, the seedBlogs script must be
included before any output is generated so that seedBlogs can pass cookie 
information to browsers as part of the HTTP headers (headers must be sent 
before the actual data contents).  Any non-PHP code (for example, white space) 
in your file that occurs before you include seedBlogs counts as output.  Thus, 
the very first line of your file should look something like this: 

<?php  include_once( "seedBlogs.php" );  ?> 

In other words, the "<" should be the first character in your file.  If your
file instead looked like this:

Hey <?php  include_once( "seedBlogs.php" );  ?> 

The string "Hey " would be the start of the output, and the HTTP headers would
be sent by the server before seedBlogs was loaded and got a chance to insert
its cookie information.  A warning message, such as "Warning: Cannot add 
header information - headers already sent," would be generated by PHP.

Other than the include operation for the seedBlogs script, none of the other
seedBlogs calls need to occur in a special location in your .php files. 



-- Extra BBCode tags --

In addition to the tags described here 

    http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/faq.php?mode=bbcode

seedBlogs supports a few more:


 -- [centerblock] [/centerblock]  centers a left-aligned block of text

 -- [quote] [/quote]              block quotations

 -- [code] [/code]                formatting blocks of programming code 




-- Function calls --

There are are four main function calls that you will need to use when building
a seedBlogs-powered website:
 -- seedBlogs_showLoginBox
 -- seedBlogs_showSearchBox
 -- seedBlog
 -- seedBlogFormatted

In addition, if you want to generate RSS feeds, you will need:
 -- seedBlogRSSLink 
 -- seedBlogRSSButton

These six function calls, each with relatively straight-forward parameters,
will give you complete control over the seedBlogs on your website.
Some of these functions (particularly seedBlogFormatted), have long lists of
parameters that might seem overwhelming at first.  However, as you read
through the documentation, you will find that these parameters are easy to 
understand:  most of them are just flags that turn various features on and off.

Each function is described in detail below.




----   seedBlogs_showLoginBox

----   Displays either a login form or information about the currently 
       logged-in user (along with a logout link).

----   Parameters:  none

----   Example usage:

       <?php  seedBlogs_showLoginBox()  ?>





----   seedBlogs_showSearchBox

----   Displays the search box (used to search all seedBlogs in the current
       installation).

----   Parameters:

       seedBlogs_showSearchBox(

             // Defaults to 15.
           $inFieldWidth, 
             // Set to true to show a Search button, or false to hide the 
             // button.
