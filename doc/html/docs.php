Installing seedBlogs on your web server is a simple process, and a web-based setup script is included.  
The text document <A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/hcsoftware/seedBlogs/doc/INSTALL.txt">INSTALL.txt</A> describes this process.
All of the seedBlogs function calls are documented in the <A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/hcsoftware/seedBlogs/doc/README.txt">README.txt</A> file.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5><B>Server Requirements</B></FONT> seedBlogs was developed on a system running Apache 1.3.26,  PHP 4.1.2, and MySQL 3.23.49.
It should work with any modern PHP/MySQL web server configuration.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5><B>Credits</B></FONT> Most of the PHP code for seedBlogs was written from scratch by me, <A HREF="http://jasonrohrer.n3.net">Jason Rohrer</A>.
Two HTML/BBCode processing functions were taken from Noah Medling's <A HREF="http://rcsoft.co.nr/">RCBlog</A> project.
