Version 0.2  ???

--Added seedBlogs?action=version response (to show script version number)

--Changed so that headline format strings are placed inside the link tags
  instead of around the link tags for headline-only lists.  Story block format
  tags, which were formerly ignored for headline-only lists, are now used
  around the link tags.  This gives more control over link apperance, but
  some 0.1.2-compatible sites will need to be modified to work correctly 
  with the 0.2 script.

  identification cookies.

  These tags are not part of the official BBCode set.
