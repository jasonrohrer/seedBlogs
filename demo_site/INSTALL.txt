To install this demo site on your web server:


1.  Copy all .php files into a directory on your server.

2.  Copy seedBlogs.php into the same directory.

3.  Edit settings.php to match the configuration of your MySQL server, as
    described in the seedBlogs INSTALL.txt.

4.  DO NOT run through the web-based setup at this point.  Instead:

5.  Open a URL to   setup_demo_databse.php   from a web browser.



NOTE:  If you are trying to setup the demo data in a database that already
       has the demo tables in it, this script will display an error message.
       Open a URL to   remove_demo_tables.php   from a web browser to 
       remove the old tables first.
